    <p>I'm a very "all over the place" kinda person. Sometimes I like to go out and spend some time in nature (fish,
      bbq, you know ;) ). Other days I like to be a hermit and watch TV, play video games and cook with my wife.</p>
    <p>I used to do a lot of traveling, mostly through the US, however, I have been out of the country multiple times. I
      love my family more than anything, and it seems to grow everyday. I hope that my future can give me children of my
      own and a means to sustain them. I'd also like to build my own home one day!</p>
